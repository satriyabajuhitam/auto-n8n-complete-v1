### ü§© What This Script Does For You!

Think of this script as your personal DevOps buddy. It automates:

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è N8N Installation (via Docker):** Gets the core N8N platform running in a containerized environment.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Custom N8N Docker Image:** Builds a special N8N image pre-loaded with:
    *   `FFmpeg`: For all your video/audio processing needs.
    *   `yt-dlp`: The super handy tool for downloading videos (perfect for YouTube!).
    *   `Puppeteer` (`n8n-nodes-puppeteer` included): For powerful web scraping and browser automation.
*   **üîí Automatic SSL/TLS:** Sets up Caddy as a reverse proxy, automatically securing your N8N instance with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt (highly recommended!) or an internal one for testing.
*   **üß† Smart Swap Memory Setup:** Checks your server's RAM and automatically configures swap space if needed, ensuring smoother performance for N8N.
*   **üíæ Daily Automatic Workflow & Credentials Backup:** Protects your hard work by backing up all your N8N workflows, credentials, and database files daily.
*   **üîÑ Auto-Update Mechanism:** Keeps your N8N instance and `yt-dlp` (both on host and in container) up-to-date automatically, without you lifting a finger!
*   **Persistent Data Storage:** Your N8N data (workflows, credentials, files) is safely stored on your host machine, even if containers are recreated.
*   **üó£Ô∏è User-Friendly & Interactive:** Guides you through the process with clear questions and helpful messages.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Idempotent:** You can safely run this script multiple times! It's smart enough to detect what's already installed/configured and will just update or skip.

### üöÄ Getting Started (It's Super Easy!)

Before we begin, make sure your server meets a few basic requirements:

#### ‚ú® Prerequisites

*   **A Fresh VPS/Server:** Running a Debian or Ubuntu-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+).
*   **Root or Sudo Access:** You'll need to run the script with `sudo` privileges.
*   **Active Domain/Subdomain:** Your chosen domain (e.g., `n8n.yourdomain.com`) must be pointed to your server's public IP address via an `A` record in your DNS settings. The script will double-check this for you!
*   **Open Ports:** Ensure ports **80 (HTTP)** and **443 (HTTPS)** are open on your server's firewall. Caddy needs these for SSL and web traffic.
    *   *Example for UFW firewall:*
        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
        sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
        sudo ufw enable # If UFW isn't active yet
        ```
*   **Internet Connection:** Your VPS needs to be connected to the internet to download packages.

#### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Installation Steps

Ready to get your N8N superpower? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Connect to Your VPS:** Open your terminal and SSH into your server.
    ```bash
    ssh your_user@your_server_ip
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Grab the script from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satriyabajuhitam/auto-n8n-complete-v1.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd auto-n8n-complete-v1
    ```

4.  **Give the Script Permission to Run:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x complete-deploy-n8n.sh
    ```

5.  **Run the Script!** This is the exciting part!
    ```bash
    sudo ./complete-deploy-n8n.sh
    ```
    *   The script will start chatting with you!
    *   It will ask you for your **domain or subdomain** (e.g., `n8n.example.com`). Type it in and hit Enter. The script will verify if it's pointing correctly.
    *   It will then ask if you want to use **Let's Encrypt for SSL**.
        *   **Highly Recommended (`y`):** Say `y` and provide your email address. Caddy will automatically handle getting and renewing your trusted SSL certificate.
        *   **For Testing (`n`):** If you say `n`, it will use an internal SSL certificate, and your browser will show a privacy warning. This is fine for testing but not for public access.

6.  **Sit Back and Relax:** The script will take care of the rest! It will install Docker, build your custom N8N image, set up Caddy, configure backups, and get everything running. This process might take a few minutes, so maybe grab a coffee! ‚òï

### üéâ Post-Installation Goodies!

Once the script finishes, you'll see a success message. Here's what you need to know:

*   **Access N8N:** You can now open your web browser and visit:
    üëâ **`https://YOUR.DOMAIN`** (replace `YOUR.DOMAIN` with the domain you entered)

*   **N8N's Home:** All your N8N configuration, database, and custom files are stored safely in:
    `$N8N_DIR` (default: `/home/n8n`)

*   **Auto-Update:** Your N8N instance will check for updates and update itself every 12 hours.
    *   Update Log: `$N8N_DIR/update.log`

*   **Backups:** Daily backups of your workflows and credentials run automatically at **2 AM** server time.
    *   Backup Files: `$N8N_DIR/files/backup_full/n8n_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
    *   The script keeps the 30 most recent backups.
    *   Backup Log: `$N8N_DIR/files/backup_full/backup.log`

*   **YouTube Data:** Any videos downloaded via `yt-dlp` through N8N will be saved in:
    `$N8N_DIR/files/youtube_data/`

*   **`yt-dlp` on Host:** If you want to use `yt-dlp` directly from your server's command line (outside of N8N), you might need to manually add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable after logging out and back in.

### üõ°Ô∏è Making Your N8N "Production Ready" & Secure!

The installation script gets you a great start, but for a truly robust and secure production environment, consider these extra steps. Think of it as beefing up your N8N fortress! üí™

#### 1. Enhanced Security Measures

*   **Strong Admin Credentials:** After your first login to N8N, **immediately set a strong, unique password** for your administrator account. Don't use defaults!
*   **Firewall Hardening:** The script opens ports 80 and 443 for Caddy. **Crucially, ensure port 5678 (N8N's internal port) is NOT open to the public** on your VPS firewall. Consider limiting SSH access (port 22) to only your known IP addresses if possible.
*   **Secure Secret Management:** For highly sensitive information (like external API keys, database credentials), storing them directly in `docker-compose.yml` environment variables is not ideal.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a `.env` file in your `$N8N_DIR` (which should **NEVER** be committed to Git). Refer to variables from this `.env` file in your `docker-compose.yml` with `env_file: .env`.
*   **Regular Host OS Updates:** Beyond N8N and Docker updates (handled by the script), keep your underlying VPS operating system updated.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt autoremove -y
    sudo reboot # After kernel or critical updates
    ```

#### 2. Stability & High Availability

*   **External Database (Highly Recommended!):** By default, N8N uses SQLite (a file-based database) which is great for small setups. However, for production, it's a **must** to switch to a robust external database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL/MariaDB**.
    *   This offers better performance under load, allows for horizontal scaling of N8N, and is more resilient to data corruption.
    *   You can set up a separate Docker container for PostgreSQL on the same server, or ideally, use a managed database service from your cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed Databases).
    *   *This requires modifying N8N's environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `DB_TYPE`, `DB_POSTGRES_HOST`).*
*   **Container Resource Limits:** Prevent N8N or Caddy from hogging all your server's resources. Add `deploy.resources.limits` to your `docker-compose.yml` services:
    ```yaml
    services:
      n8n:
        # ...
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '2.0'  # Max 2 CPU cores
              memory: 4096M # Max 4GB RAM
      caddy:
        # ...
        deploy:
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '0.5'
              memory: 256M
    ```
    *Adjust these values based on your VPS specs and N8N's workload.*
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Don't wait for things to break! Set up monitoring for:
    *   **N8N/Caddy Uptime:** Is the service running?
    *   **VPS Resource Usage:** CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, disk space.
    *   **N8N Health:** N8N has a `/healthz` endpoint you can monitor.
    *   **Tools:** Simple tools like UptimeRobot, or more advanced solutions like Prometheus/Grafana (for metrics) and Loki/Grafana or an ELK stack (for centralized logs). Integrate alerts to Slack, email, etc.
*   **Off-site Backups & Disaster Recovery Plan:** The script backs up to your server. For true production readiness, **move these backups to an off-site location** (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage, Dropbox, or another server).
    *   **Crucially:** **Regularly TEST your disaster recovery process!** Don't find out your backups are corrupted or your restore process fails when your server is down.

#### 3. Performance Optimizations

*   **Adequate VPS Resources:** N8N, especially with Puppeteer or heavy workflows, can be resource-intensive. If you experience slowdowns, consider upgrading your VPS's RAM and CPU.
*   **Timezone Verification:** The script sets `GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Asia/Jakarta`. Ensure this is correct for your location in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 4. Logging Management

*   **Host Log Rotation:** Ensure your host system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, Docker logs) are properly rotated to prevent disk space issues. `logrotate` is usually pre-configured but it's good to check.
*   **Centralized Logging (Optional):** For larger setups, consider pushing container logs to a centralized logging system for easier searching and analysis.

#### 5. Documentation

*   **Document Your Setup:** Even with an automated script, keep a personal record of your domain, SSL choices, any custom modifications you made, and your backup/recovery procedures. This will save you headaches later!
